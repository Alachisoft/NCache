# Build Integrations #

Note: Integrations for SignalR, NCacheSessionServices & EFNcacheProvider will only be built using Visual Studio.

The scripts available here are not meant to be used independently. Running them independently will not make them work since the relative paths within these scripts will not direct to the desired locations. These can only be used by `build.bat` script available in the parent folder of this folder.
