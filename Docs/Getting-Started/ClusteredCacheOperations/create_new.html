			<p>A clustered cache can be Partitioned or Replicated.   This section describes how to create these caches.</p>
			<p>From the 'File' menu select 'New'-&gt;'Clustered Cache'. A 'New Clustered Cache Wizard' will appear. Steps to create a new clustered cache through wizard are as follows: </p>
			<br>
			<h3 class="dth4">Step 1 of 6<a name="step1"></a></h3>
			<br><p><IMG alt="New Cluster Wizard Tab 1" src="new_cluster_wiz_1.jpg"></p>
			<br>
			<p><STRONG>Name:</STRONG> Provide a unique identifier for the clustered cache. For a   cluster, the identifier has to be unique on all the nodes that are a part of   it.</p>
			<br>
			<h3 class="dth4"><a name="port_conflict"></a>Step 2 of 6</h3>
			<br><p><img src="new_cluster_wiz_2.jpg"></p>
			<br>
			<p><STRONG>Cluster Scheme:</STRONG> </p>
			<p>Mirrored cache is a cluster of two nodes (Active and passive), where all operations are performed on active node while the passive node is updated asynchronously. Passive node is promoted to active node as soon as the active node goes down. The Partitioned scheme partitions the data across the cluster, whereas the 
			  Replicatedscheme provides data replication on all the nodes. Partitioned Replica scheme is same as a regular partitioned cache but it allows you to have replicas   for each partition, replication can be done either synchronously or asynchronously.			</p>
			<p><STRONG>Operation timeout (sec):</STRONG> The maximum time&nbsp;in seconds   during which a clustered operation must&nbsp;be completed, otherwise the operation   will fail.</p>
			<p><STRONG>Statistics replication interval (sec's.): </STRONG>The time&nbsp;interval   in seconds after which a node sends its statistics to all the other nodes in the   cluster.	</p>
<br>
			<p>In case of <strong>Partitioned Replica</strong> cache you can have the choice to select the replication strategy for your cache using the screen shown below. Replication Strategy screen will only be encountered in case of POR. </p>
			<p><strong>Replication Strategy: </strong>Replication Strategy is defines as how the data is replicated to the backup node. It can be Asynchronous only in Professional Edition. </p>
			<ul>
			  <ul>
			    <li><strong>Asynchronous replication:</strong> In Asynchronous replication data operations are replicated asynchronously to the backup node.</li>
			    <li><strong>Synchronous replication:</strong> In Synchronous replication data operations are replicated synchronously to the backup node.</li>
		      </ul>
		  </ul>

			<br>
			<h3><strong>Step 3 of 6<a name="step3"></a></strong></h3>
			<br><p>In step 3, you will need to select nodes that will participate in cluster.<br>
			
			<br><p><img src="new_cluster_wiz_3.jpg"></p>
		<br>
			<p><STRONG>Select nodes:</STRONG> Select nodes that participate in the   cluster. You can specify a node name or select one from the list of available   nodes.</p>
			<br>
			<h3 class="dth4">Step 4 of 6<a name="step5"></a></h3>
			<br><p><img src="new_cluster_wiz_5.jpg"></p>
			<br>
			<p><STRONG>Cluster Port:</STRONG> TCP based communication between the cluster   nodes requires a well known TCP server port for the establishment of the   connection with peers. To avoid conflicts, it is preferable to have a unique port   for every cluster. The default port is a proposed non-conflicting port for the cluster by NCache. </p>
			<p>You can  also change the cluster port manually. In case of port conflict, a warning message  will be shown.</p>
			<br>
			<h3 class="dth4">Step 5 of 6<a name="step6"></a></h3>
			<br><p><img src="new_cluster_wiz_6.jpg"></p>
			<br>
			<p><STRONG>Storage Type:</STRONG> Specifies the storage type
			for the   primary cache.</p>
			<p><STRONG>Maximum Size:</STRONG> Specifies an upper limit on the   size of the cache in MB.  The number of items in the cache are limited by maximum size of the cache and   amount of free system memory (virtual or physical). </p>
			<br>
			<h3 class="dth4">Step 6 of 6<a name="step7"></a></h3>
			<br><p><img src="new_cluster_wiz_7.jpg"></p>
			<br>
			<p><STRONG>Eviction Policy:</STRONG> Specifies the eviction policy   to&nbsp;determine which items are to be removed from cache, if it is full, to   accommodate new items.</p>
			<p><STRONG>Default Priority: </STRONG>Specifies default priority, that is associated   with an item, if no priority is specified for&nbsp;that item.</p>
			<p><STRONG>Eviction Percentage: </STRONG>Specifies the percentage of items to be   removed&nbsp;on each eviction.</p>
			<p><STRONG>Clean Interval (sec.): </STRONG>The&nbsp;periodic interval after which the   expired items are removed from the cache.<STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></p>
			<p><STRONG>Start this cache on finish: </STRONG>If this&nbsp;check box is checked then this new cache will start automatically as you click the finish.</p>
