### Introduction

This sample program demonstrates how to use NCache with Asp.Net SignalR for real time web operations.

It uses a partitioned cache named, 'myPartitionedCache', which is registered on your machine upon the installation of NCache.
And a key for events registration on cache. Both of these values can be provided in web.config. 


### Prerequisites

Before the sample application is executed make sure that:

- Dot Net framework 4.5 or later.
- web.config has been changed according to the configurations. 
	- Change the cache name
	- Change the eventkey
- By default this sample uses 'myPartitionedCache', make sure that cache is running. 

### Build and Run the Sample
